this is just a silly project I made after following VanZeeben's youtube
tutorials on java game making.

some classes (Game.java, InputHandler.java, Tile.java, and Level.java) are almost directly
from his tutorial. Other classes like screen essentially do the same thing but were coded by me

other classes (items, lighting, buffs, "shaders") were made by me

the class layout is derived from his tutorial, although I've expanded on it a lot

the point is that this project was educational and is built on top of what VanZeeben did

IMPORTANT NOTE:
!graphics are all computed with a raster using the CPU!!!!! (YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT)
!this was how the tutorial was done, i would NEVER DO THIS unless I was just coding for fun
!AGAIN, THE GRAPHICS WILL NOT BE ANYTHING CLOSE TO OPTIMAL. THIS WAS EDUCATIONAL.

controls:
WSAD/up,down,left,right to move
E enables lighting
